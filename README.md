Intro to Machine Learning Project
Purpose:  In this project, you will employ machine learning.  For our course, we will limit this to simple linear regression, which is supervised learning. We will use simple linear regression to train a model using all available data and us the resulting model (a "best-fit" straight line) to make predictions.
